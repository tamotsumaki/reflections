How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Very nice.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	Sure.
	
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	Pros: Reasonably understandable.
	Cons: Possible file loss.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Google Docs are more likely documentation storage. Each docs are independent. Git or SVN or those programming version control system are different. Main purpose of those tools are track versions/revisions. Hence usual program has built by multiple source files. Logically, needs to trucking multple file at once.
	
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	Identify each commit ID by using git log, then compare by git diff.
	
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	:)
	
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	Programming repository.
